As a client to the movies service
I want to be able to search the movies by genre from the same /movies endpoint
so that I can get the movie list of specific genre

AC1
Given a GET request is received in /movies endpoint
When the query parameter genre is present and not null
Then the service should return the movie list in that genre

AC2
Given a GET request is received in /movies endpoint
When the query parameter genre is missing or null
Then the service should return the movie list in all genres

http://localhost:8080/movies?from=2015&to=2017&genre=Comedy
