As a client to the movies service
I want to be able to load the movie data in csv format into the movie service
so that I can get the movie list later

AC1
Given a POST request is received in /csv endpoint
When the query parameter fileName is present and not null
And data load is successful
Then the service should load the movie data from resource/csv/fileName.csv into dongodb movie collection

AC2
Given a POST request is received in /csv endpoint
When the query parameter fileName is not present or null
Then the service should return 400 HTTP status code

AC3
Given a POST request is received in /csv endpoint
When the query parameter fileName is present and not null
And data load is unsuccessful
Then the service should return 500 HTTP status code

sample request:
http://localhost:8080/csv?fileName=movieList1

sample response:
"Successfully load the data"
