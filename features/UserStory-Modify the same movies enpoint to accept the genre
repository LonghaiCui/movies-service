As a client to the movies service
I want to be able to search the movies by genre from the same /movies endpoint
so that get the movie list of specific genre

AC1
Given a GET request is received in /movies endpoint
When the query parameter genre is present and not null
Then the service should return the movie list in that genre

AC2
Given a GET request is received in /movies endpoint
When the query parameter genre is missing or null
Then the service should return the movie list in all genres


sample request payload:
{
   ...
}

sample response payload:
{
   ...
}
