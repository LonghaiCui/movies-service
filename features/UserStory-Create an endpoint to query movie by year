As a client to the movies service
I want to be able to search the movies by year from the service
so that get the movie list of specific year or a range of years

AC1
Given a GET request is received in /movies endpoint
When the queryString is year and the value is valid (from 1900 to 2100)
Then the service should return the movie list in that year

AC2
Given a GET request is received in /movies endpoint
When the queryString is year and the value is not valid (before 1900 or after 2100)
Then the service should return error response with 400 status code

AC3
Given a GET request is received in /movies endpoint
When the queryStrings are "from" and "to"
And the values are valid ("from" is bigger than 1900 and "to" is smaller than 2100)
Then the service should return the movie list between that years

AC4
Given a GET request is received in /movies endpoint
When the queryStrings both "from" and "to" are present
And the values are not valid ("from" is smaller than 1900 or "to" is bigger than 2100)
Then the service should return error response with 400 status code

AC5
Given a GET request is received in /movies endpoint
When only one of "from" and "to" is present
Then the service should return error response with 400 status code
